## 💼 About Me

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My work sits at the intersection of **software, economics, and security** — from building distributed web infrastructure and A/B testing pipelines to researching the economics of vulnerability disclosure and public cybersecurity investment.

- I’ve interned at **NVIDIA** as a Technical PM and currently conduct research on how **social media infrastructure can enable behavioral economics insights**. I also spent time in the US Government (as an intern) supporting **The White House and Department of State**, which reflects my commitment to secure and ethical technology practices.
